    <h1>The Puzzle of Me</h1>
    <p>Often when I’m facing a challenge, I remember a very distinct hollowness. It’s not constant. It doesn’t follow me around day to day. But in those moments when everything feels like too much, when doubt creeps in and the urge to quit starts whispering, I feel it again. A quiet sense that something inside me isn’t quite whole.</p>
<p>It doesn’t scream or ache. It just settles quietly, like a hum in the background that never turns off. It’s not a sharp pain, but a dull presence, a faint awareness that something important was misplaced along the way. It lives in hesitation, in the sudden heaviness of simple decisions, in the quiet voice that asks, “What’s the point?” And I’ve learned to recognize it for what it is. Not a flaw, but a signal. A memory of everything I left unfinished.</p>
<p>Over time, I’ve come to understand it more clearly. That hollowness is made of the things I walked away from. The goals I never followed through on. The relationships I let go of too easily. The parts of myself I abandoned in moments of doubt, fear, or pride. Each one is like a puzzle I started but never finished. Some were barely begun. Others were almost complete, just missing a few pieces. And yet, I walked away from all of them.</p>
<p>They didn’t disappear. They collected in the background of my life like forgotten projects in an old room. And slowly, without meaning to, they started to shape me. Not because of what they were, but because I believed leaving them behind said something about me. I began to think of myself not as someone who tried, but as someone who quit. The weight of all those unfinished puzzles settled in my self-image, and it changed how I approached everything else.</p>
<p>Every now and then, though, I pause. I take a breath. I step away from the noise, the pace, the pressure. And in those moments of stillness, something strange happens. The light changes. I notice my own shadow, stretched out in front of me, and through it I can see the gaps. The places where the light passes through me. The holes left by the puzzles I never returned to. The pieces I never placed.</p>
<p>I used to believe happiness waited at the end of completion. That I needed to finish something, become someone, achieve something, prove something, in order to feel whole. But that belief began to crack the more I lived with the weight of what was left undone.</p>
<p>Happiness, I’ve come to believe, doesn’t exist at the edge of the puzzle. It’s not waiting in the final piece. It lives in the act of showing up. Of sitting down with yourself, even when it’s hard, and choosing to try again. It’s in placing one more piece, even when you’re not sure what the picture is supposed to be anymore. It’s in the choice to continue, even with doubt sitting beside you.</p>
<p>Perfection was never the goal. Completion was never the promise. The real work is presence. The real courage is in not giving up on yourself. Some of those puzzles may never be finished. And that’s okay. Their existence still matters. They tell the story of someone who dared to begin.</p>
<p>So when the light comes again, and it always does, I want it to fall not only through the gaps, but onto the pieces I chose to place. The ones I stayed for. The ones I gave myself to, even when it was hard. That’s the story I want my life to tell. Not one of perfection, but of persistence.</p>
<p>Maybe wholeness isn’t about having every piece in place. Maybe it’s about choosing to keep building, even when you’re not sure what the picture was supposed to be.</p>
