### **The Average Life: 30,000 Days**

---

### **Time Perception & Psychology**

- Time feels slower as a kid because the brain records new experiences. As adults, routines make time feel faster.
- Living passively (e.g., scrolling social media) diminishes the richness of life.
- **Solution:** Regularly try new experiences. Learn a new skill every month to keep your brain focused and life engaging.
- Focus on what you can achieve in a year, not just a month.

### **Priority Management**

- Knowing **what not to do** is more valuable than knowing what to do.
- Eliminate distractions and time-wasters ruthlessly.
- Prioritize high-impact actions to maximize growth.

### **Relationship Dynamics**

- Relationships are like banks: deposit positivity (gestures, compliments) and minimize withdrawals (mistakes).
- Small, consistent acts of kindness matter more than rare big gestures.
- **Shared struggles** create stronger bonds.
- Weak ties (casual relationships) help you grow socially.
- Giving time to others makes you feel like you have more time.

### **Career & Purpose**

- Growth happens outside your comfort zone.
- The **Adjacent Possible**: Aim for the intersection of what you know and what you don’t.
- Focus on learning. Money follows knowledge.
- Forget the career ladder—move sideways, diagonally, or even backward to build unique skills.

### **Mental Models**

    - Ask questions twice and seek multiple opinions.
