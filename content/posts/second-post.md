I’ve been really thinking about my relationship with Natalie.
I guess it comes to a couple things:
1. I don’t really see myself marrying her, my family don’t like her and I think there will be a lot of a cultural clash.
2. I still feel like I put in more into the relationship than she does. I put my feelings aside so much so she feels better. I contributed 50% more financially. Maybe even close to 80% and now since I’m fasting from sex it’s more of a reason to say that I really don’t get any kind of love from her other than physically. The not sending pictures really hit hard cause I liked looking at them before. I feel like I have a lot of needs unmet.
3. Trapped. It feels like a chore to be with her. Like I dread driving to see he, or to spend time with her.
I’ll buy her flowers and write her a note maybe it’ll make her feel better, and she’ll show me more lover. But I think I have to set a certain deadline that if she doesn’t give me specific stuff from here by a certain date than the relationship just isn’t meant to be. Maybe I should just start being super cold and leaver her. No that’s mean. She deserve an explanation.
