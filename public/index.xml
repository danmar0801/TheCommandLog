      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been really thinking about my relationship with Natalie.&#xA;I guess it comes to a couple things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I donâ€™t really see myself marrying her, my family donâ€™t like her and I think there will be a lot of a cultural clash.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I still feel like I put in more into the relationship than she does. I put my feelings aside so much so she feels better. I contributed 50% more financially. Maybe even close to 80% and now since Iâ€™m fasting from sex itâ€™s more of a reason to say that I really donâ€™t get any kind of love from her other than physically. The not sending pictures really hit hard cause I liked looking at them before. I feel like I have a lot of needs unmet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trapped. It feels like a chore to be with her. Like I dread driving to see he, or to spend time with her.&#xA;Iâ€™ll buy her flowers and write her a note maybe itâ€™ll make her feel better, and sheâ€™ll show me more lover. But I think I have to set a certain deadline that if she doesnâ€™t give me specific stuff from here by a certain date than the relationship just isnâ€™t meant to be. Maybe I should just start being super cold and leaver her. No thatâ€™s mean. She deserve an explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>
